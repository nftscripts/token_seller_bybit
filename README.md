# Bot for fast selling SUI after listing

The bot sells through limit orders, because there is no possibility to sell on the market right after the listing.

1. Go here (https://www.bybit.com/app/user/api-management) and create an account API key;
2. Fill in /data/accounts.json (proxy format: "http://login:pass@ip:port"); 
3. Install libraries from the requirements.txt file;
4. Run the main.py file.
